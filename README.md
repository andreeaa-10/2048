I developed an engaging <b>2048 game</b> in C, utilizing the <b>ncurses library</b> to implement a user-friendly graphical interface that enhances
player experience.
I created algorithms to manage game mechanics, including tile merging and scoring, ensuring a responsive and challenging gameplay experience and
integrated features such as undo and resume
functionalities and game-over conditions.
