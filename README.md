    2048

I developed an engaging <b>2048 game</b> in C, utilizing the <b>ncurses library</b> to implement a user-friendly graphical interface that enhances
player experience.
I created algorithms to manage game mechanics, including tile merging and scoring, ensuring a responsive and challenging gameplay experience and
integrated features such as undo and resume
functionalities and game-over conditions.

<h3>
    Game rules
</h3>
2048 is played on a 4Ã—4 grid featuring numbered tiles that move smoothly when directed by the four arrow keys. Each time the tiles are shifted, a new
tile appears randomly in one of the empty spaces on the board. Tiles move as far as they can in the chosen direction, stopping only when they collide
with another tile or reach the edge of the grid. If two tiles with the same number collide during the move, they merge into a single tile with a value 
equal to the sum of the two. This merged tile cannot combine with any other tile in the same move.
